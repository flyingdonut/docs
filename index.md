Flying Donut, Scrum and Kanban software you love 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Flying Donut is a powerful, simple, effective, collaborative online Scrum and Kanban tool,
set out, from the start, to be a real-time agile collaboration tool, to allow transparency
and communication across distributed, remote or co-located teams.

Simplicity is the core idea underlying the design of Flying Donut, allowing teams to be agile 
and not just practice agile. It goes back to the basics of agile, with a real-time interface 
that makes collaboration so fluid, effortlessly.
