# Getting Started With Your Project
{: .no_toc .fs-9 }

You already have a project in mind. Before getting started with the framework,
it would be helpful if you decided on:
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

1. The project's phases.
1. A categorization for the jobs you need to do.

## Determining the project's phases
To help you decide on the project's phases, think of deadlines and what you want to accomplish during each deadline. For example, for a software-related project, your phases might be: Requirements Gathering, Setup basic infrastructure, Feature implementation, etc.

For a non-software project, for example organizing your house move, use phases specific to your project: Before the move, Moving Day, After the move, etc.

Determine reasonable deadlines for each phase. Phases can be of different lengths, and each phase may have one or more goals associated with it.

## Determining a categorization for the tasks at hand
For some projects, everything could fall under a single My-ToDo-List. 
For other projects, more categories might be useful. The categories are there to help you, 
they are not imposed by the system.
