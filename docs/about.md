# About Flying Donut

Flying Donut is a powerful, simple, effective, collaborative online Scrum and Kanban tool, 
set out, from the start, to be a real-time agile collaboration tool, to allow transparency 
and communication across distributed, remote or co-located teams. 

Simplicity is the core idea underlying the design of Flying Donut, allowing teams to be agile and not just practice 
agile. It goes back to the basics of agile, with a real-time interface that makes collaboration so fluid, effortlessly.
