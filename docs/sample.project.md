# A Sample Project
{: .no_toc .fs-9 }

We are going to use Flying Donut to track our house move on May 19th.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

There are things that need to be taken care of regarding the old house and the new house. 
There are also some Kid's related tasks, so these are the categories we will use. In Flying Donut, 
the categories can be represented with backlog buckets or labels.

In terms of deadlines, there are things to do before the move, the day of the move, and after the move, 
so these will be our phases, or sprints.

We are now ready to start entering all this information into Flying Donut:

Log in to your account to create a project. Locate the `+` button in the upper right corner, in the projects,
or dashboard page:

![Project Tutorial - Projects List - Create Project Button](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.23-25-27.png)

Specify the project name, its visibility, and the project type. By default, the project will be created as a private project. 
You can change the visibility to `public` to make it visible to everybody including search engines.

The supported project types are:
- **Kanban:** In `KANBAN` you don't have time boxes or sprints. The board is used to see and change the state of the cards,
  in user defined columns.  
- **Simple Scrum:** In plain old `SCRUM` the accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks
  of the cards in the current sprint. The columns of the tasks are fixed to  `To Do`, `Doing` and `Done` states.
  Cards with all their tasks `done` are considered as done.
- **Scrumban:** In `SCRUMBAN` the accompanying kanban board is used on top of the scrum framework, supporting 
  all functionality of scrum and kanban. Nowadays, it is considered as the modern way of doing scrum.

![Project Tutorial - Create Project Modal](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.13-46-15.png)

Select the project from the projects list, to go to the project's page.

![Project Tutorial - Projects List](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.23-25-14.png)

At this point there is very limited information in the project page, but you see that you more options at left-hand
side the menu. This menu is enabled when you are in a project context: 

![Project Tutorial - Project Overview](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.13-48-12.png)

### Creating the Project Sprints (Phases)

Create a sprint for each of the project's phases. Locate the `+` button in the upper right corner, in the sprints page.
Add a name, a description (with your sprint goal), and tentative start and end dates.

![Project Tutorial - Create Sprint](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-19-04.png)

For this example, we create three sprints:

- Before the move
- Move days
- After the move

![Project Tutorial - Sprints](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-22-56.png)

We used May 22nd to 29th as the move dates, so the sprints before and after the move are marked accordingly. 
Notice that when you are setting up your own project, you do not have to specify the dates if you are not 
sure of them. Dates are used to order the sprints in the sprints page. They are also used in the project 
summary pages and charts, to provide information regarding whether the project is on track or behind schedule.

In the Sprint List, you will see among other things, depending on the start and end dates, 
and if the sprint has started, is completed or not: 

1. The sprint has started and have a number of days left.
1. The sprint is overdue.   
1. The sprint is done.
1. The sprint will start in number of days.

### Defining the Card Categories, or Backlog Buckets

Select Backlog from the left-side menu. When a project is created, a Default backlog bucket is created:

Select the Default bucket and click on the `edit` button located on the top right-hand side.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Default bucket](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.13-55-09.png)

Rename it to Old House.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Rename Default bucket](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.13-55-26.png)

Locate the `+` button in the backlog bucket navigation list to add a new bucket. 

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Create bucket button](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.13-55-43.png)

An input text field appears. Specify a name for the new bucket, New House:

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Create bucket](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.13-55-52.png)

Similarly create the Kid's Stuff bucket:

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - buckets](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.13-56-45.png)

### Adding Cards to Backlog

Each backlog bucket has an `+` button at the toolbar. 

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Add card](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-05-03.png)

When you click on the button, an input field appears. Simply type the name of the card in the input text box, 
and hit `Enter` or click on the `Add Card` button.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Add card input](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-05-14.png)

You can add as many items as you can think of. Remember that these are higher level work items, that we 
can break down into smaller tasks later.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Add card input](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-06-01.png)

Do not worry about thinking of everything up front. You can come back and add more items to your list at
any point.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Cards](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-16-36.png)


Add more details for each item, in the item's details. By clicking on the name of the card, the card details
modal will appear, where you can add description, attachments, tasks, comments, and topics.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Add card input](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-07-04.png)

### Moving the Cards around in the Backlog

The cards can be moved around in backlog via drag 'n drop. The order from top to bottom is used to order the priority
of each card. There are times that you need to move a card from one bucket to another one, though. 

Locate the `Move Cards to Buckets` button and click on it. 

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Move Cards to Bucket button](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-15-24.png)

Once you click on the button, you will see a slightly different view that makes it easier to move the cards to another
backlog bucket. 

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Move Cards to Bucket](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-15-27.png)

Just drag 'n drop the card you want to the bucket you want. We will move the cards to the proper bucket after a some 
extra thoughts in our project.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Move Card to Bucket](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-15-46.png)

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Move Card 2 to Bucket](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-16-27.png)

Click on the `Move Cards to Buckets` button again to return to normal view to continue working as usual.

![Project Tutorial - Backlog - Normal view](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-16-36.png)

### Adding Cards to the Project Sprints (Phases)
Now that we have a list of cards (work items), we can add them to our sprints. What needs to be done 
before the move? What should we remember to do during the moving day? What can wait until after the move?

Click on the `Plan` button in the "Before the Move" sprint, to see this sprint's planning view.

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan button](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-23-11.png)

In the sprint planning view, you see two distinct areas:
- Backlog
- Sprint Board

Drag 'n drop the cards from the selected backlog bucket into the sprint. 
  
![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-23-23.png)

Once you drop the card, the view will be updated with the counters.

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-23-29.png)

Of course the burndown chart will also be updated after a few seconds, if you added estimated tasks to the cards.

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-23-34.png)

Let's add the rest of the cards we need in this sprint.

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-24-16.png)

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-25-21.png)

To add cards from a different backlog bucket we need to click on the `Select Bucket` button, to pick the bucket we want.

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-25-53.png)

Let's add the cards we need in this sprint.

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-26-05.png)

Let's see if we need to bring something else form the "Kids Stuff" bucket.

![Project Tutorial - Sprints - Plan](/assets/moving/sc.2021-05-08.18-27-03.png)

Yep, we need to bring one more to the sprint.

### Sprint Stages

The first row shows the stages of an sprint, with Planning selected. The other stages are:
- Task Board
- Review

During the sprint planning stage you can assign work items to the sprint. When you are done assigning 
work items to the sprint, you Start it, and the sprint enters the Task Board phase. In the Task Board, 
you see the list of items and their subtasks. Each subtask is either in the To Do, Doing, or Done state.

In general, you use the Task Board to mark things Doing, and, later, Done, so you can track your progress.
The Review phase is tailored more towards larger teams working together, and may not apply on smaller 
personal projects.

### Sprint Action Buttons

The second row of action buttons, allows you to enter project Details, for example a description, 
and a start and end date, if not already specified. It also shows a burn down chart, for this sprint. 
There are also buttons to Start and Finish the sprint.

### Assigning Items During Planning Stage

You are presented with a view of the items in the backlog, grouped by backlog categories, or buckets. 
You can click on each of the backlog bucket names to see the list of items in that category. 
Drag and drop work items, from the backlog bucket, into the sprint space.

To drag an item, grab it from the drag-handle and drop it into the sprint space, on the left, 
below the Standalone tasks placeholder:

Drag each item that should be completed before the move into this sprint:

Note that you can select items from any of the different backlog buckets to drag into this sprint, 
   as items relating to the New House may also need to be completed before the move.

You can also create new items right in this screen. Specify the item's title in the new item's input area, 
designated with .


Assign all items from the backlog into one of the three project sprints. When you are done assigning the 
items to each sprint, you can move them around, in order of priority. Now you are ready to start working 
on your items, and track your progress.

### The Task Board

When you are done assigning work items to the sprint, you are ready to Start the "Before the move" sprint. 
The sprint now enters the Execution phase:

To add subtasks for an item, simply start typing the task name in the new task input field.

You can add detailed notes to each task, by selecting Description from the task's Actions dropdown:

When you work on each subtask, mark it as being Doing. You can either move it to the Doing state from 
the Actions dropdown, or by dragging and dropping it into the Doing column:


Similarly, when a task is completed, move it to the Done state:

Items and tasks can be in different progress states. The item's state is indicated by the icon used:

- This task or item is waiting to be started
- This task or item is in progress
- This task or item is completed.

The item's state is determined by the state of its subtasks. When all subtasks are Done, the item is 
Done too. When some tasks are Doing, the item is Doing.


When you check things off your checklist by marking them as Done, the board thins out, as only the 
first item is shown on the Done list, showing you that fewer things are left to be worked on!

## Additional Notes

### The Flying Donut Dashboard

After you start working on a project, and assign tasks to yourself to work on, the project Dashboard 
gives you a quick glimpse into your activities, and your work in progress.

### Activity Stream
The project's Activity Stream shows a listing of what happened in a project. You can use the project's 
activity stream to see what happened in a particular project, during a day. It appears at the bottom 
of the project's page, below the burndown chart:

It can be a very helpful view in situations when many people are working on the same project.
