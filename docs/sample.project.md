# A Sample Project
{: .no_toc .fs-9 }

We are going to use Flying Donut to track our house move on May 19th.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

There are things that need to be taken care of regarding the old house and the new house. 
There are also some Kid's related tasks, so these are the categories we will use. In Flying Donut, 
the categories can be represented with backlog buckets or labels.

In terms of deadlines, there are things to do before the move, the day of the move, and after the move, 
so these will be our phases, or sprints.

We are now ready to start entering all this information into Flying Donut:

Log in and create a project, from the Projects dropdown:

Specify the project name, and the start and end dates. The project end date is optional:

By default, the project will be created as a private project. You can change the visibility to public in the same dialog.

Select the project from the Projects dropdown, to go to the project's page.

At this point there is very limited information in the project page:

### Creating the Project Sprints (Phases)

Create an sprint for each of the project's phases, by selecting Create Sprint from the Sprints dropdown. 
For this example, we create three sprints:

- Before the move
- Move day
- After the move

We used May 19th as the move date, so the sprints before and after the move are marked accordingly. 
Notice that when you are setting up your own project, you do not have to specify the dates if you are not 
sure of them. Dates are used to order the sprints in the sprints page. They are also used in the project 
summary pages and charts, to provide information regarding whether the project is on track or behind schedule.

If you select Sprint List from the Sprints dropdown, you will see that, depending on the start and end dates, 
the sprints have a meter icon showing the sprints status: This sprint has not started yet.
1. This sprint is in progress.
1. This sprint has ended.

### Defining the Card Categories, or Backlog Buckets

Select Backlog from the main menu. When a project is created, a Default backlog bucket is created:

Click on the Default bucket name to change it.

Rename it to Old House:

Select New Bucket from the backlog bucket navigation pane on the left-hand side. An input text field appears. 
Specify a name for the new bucket, New House:

Similarly create the Kid's Stuff bucket:

### Adding Work Items to Backlog

Each backlog bucket has an input section, where you can specify a work item. Simply type the item name 
in the input text box, and hit Enter.

You can add as many items as you can think of. Remember that these are higher level work items, that we 
can break down into smaller tasks later. You can also add more details for each item, in the item's 
details page.

Do not worry about thinking of everything up front. You can come back and add more items to your list at 
any point.

### Adding Cards to the Project Sprints (Phases)
Now that we have a list of work items, we can assign them to the project phases: what needs to be done 
before the move? What should we remember to do during the moving day? What can wait until after the move?

From the Sprints dropdown, select Sprints List. This will show you the sprint page:

Click on the View Planning button of the Before the move sprint, to see this sprint's planning page:

In the sprint planning page, you see two rows of action buttons, on the top right. The first row shows 
the sprint stages, and the second one shows different action buttons related to this sprint.

### Sprint Stages

The first row shows the stages of an sprint, with Planning selected. The other stages are:
- Task Board
- Review

During the sprint planning stage you can assign work items to the sprint. When you are done assigning 
work items to the sprint, you Start it, and the sprint enters the Task Board phase. In the Task Board, 
you see the list of items and their subtasks. Each subtask is either in the To Do, Doing, or Done state.

In general, you use the Task Board to mark things Doing, and, later, Done, so you can track your progress.
The Review phase is tailored more towards larger teams working together, and may not apply on smaller 
personal projects.

### Sprint Action Buttons

The second row of action buttons, allows you to enter project Details, for example a description, 
and a start and end date, if not already specified. It also shows a burn down chart, for this sprint. 
There are also buttons to Start and Finish the sprint.

### Assigning Items During Planning Stage

You are presented with a view of the items in the backlog, grouped by backlog categories, or buckets. 
You can click on each of the backlog bucket names to see the list of items in that category. 
Drag and drop work items, from the backlog bucket, into the sprint space.

To drag an item, grab it from the drag-handle and drop it into the sprint space, on the left, 
below the Standalone tasks placeholder:

Drag each item that should be completed before the move into this sprint:

Note that you can select items from any of the different backlog buckets to drag into this sprint, 
   as items relating to the New House may also need to be completed before the move.

You can also create new items right in this screen. Specify the item's title in the new item's input area, 
designated with .


Assign all items from the backlog into one of the three project sprints. When you are done assigning the 
items to each sprint, you can move them around, in order of priority. Now you are ready to start working 
on your items, and track your progress.

### The Task Board

When you are done assigning work items to the sprint, you are ready to Start the "Before the move" sprint. 
The sprint now enters the Execution phase:

To add subtasks for an item, simply start typing the task name in the new task input field.

You can add detailed notes to each task, by selecting Description from the task's Actions dropdown:

When you work on each subtask, mark it as being Doing. You can either move it to the Doing state from 
the Actions dropdown, or by dragging and dropping it into the Doing column:


Similarly, when a task is completed, move it to the Done state:

Items and tasks can be in different progress states. The item's state is indicated by the icon used:

- This task or item is waiting to be started
- This task or item is in progress
- This task or item is completed.

The item's state is determined by the state of its subtasks. When all subtasks are Done, the item is 
Done too. When some tasks are Doing, the item is Doing.


When you check things off your checklist by marking them as Done, the board thins out, as only the 
first item is shown on the Done list, showing you that fewer things are left to be worked on!

## Additional Notes

### The Flying Donut Dashboard

After you start working on a project, and assign tasks to yourself to work on, the project Dashboard 
gives you a quick glimpse into your activities, and your work in progress.

### Activity Stream
The project's Activity Stream shows a listing of what happened in a project. You can use the project's 
activity stream to see what happened in a particular project, during a day. It appears at the bottom 
of the project's page, below the burndown chart:

It can be a very helpful view in situations when many people are working on the same project.
