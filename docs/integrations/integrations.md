# Integrations

Flying donut integrates with the cloud storage services [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/){:target="_blank"}
and [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com){:target="_blank"}, and with version control 
systems like [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"}, [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org){:target="_blank"}, 
and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com){:target="_blank"}.

Version control integration allows developers to link commits with cards and tasks, and apply the Flying Donut workflow 
via the commit messages. For details on how to set up and configure version control integration, please read the 
corresponding section.
