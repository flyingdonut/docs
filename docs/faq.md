## What is Flying Donut?
Flying Donut is a powerful, simple, effective, online Scrum and Kanban Software. Scrum is an iterative 
and incremental project management framework for managing different types of projects. You can use 
Flying Donut as your Agile Project Management software, to collaborate with local and remote people. 
All they need is an invitation from you to join your project.

Flying Donut improves communication between team members, while at the same time eliminating email traffic. 
Everyone's view is immediately updated when any team member modifies an entry.

Flying Donut enables you to get organized without even thinking about it. It takes no time to learn 
Flying Donut, and every action is instantaneous.

## Is Flying Donut only for software development projects?
Although agile project management practices and scrum are typically used for software development, 
we believe that any project can benefit from the use of an agile-style project management framework. 
Simply think in terms of breaking down your project into smaller components, each with its own deadline and tasks.

## Getting Started
### How do I get started?
You can create a free account in order to get started. You can choose a username and password specific to the 
Flying Donut service, or you can log in using the credentials of Googleâ„¢ OpenID Connect. For details regarding 
OpenID Connect, visit the [official pages of OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect).

### How do I create a project?
After you create an account on the Flying Donut service, click on theProjects dropdown, and select Create Project. You will be presented with a form to specify the project title, the start and end dates, and the project visibility. The project visibility by default is set to private. You can always change the visibility later, from the Project Settings option in the project dropdown.

### Do I want to create a public or private project?
If your projects are highly sensitive, you should consider making those private. Only people you have invited to your private projects can see the content or post activity of their own.

Public projects are visible in search results, and are, in general, openfor people to simply browse through. Registered users of Flying Donut can see your project pages. If you are planning a charitable fundraiser campaign, setting it up as a public project might not be a bad idea; it may generate ideas and exposure you have not even thought of.

### How do I collaborate with people?
Simply invite people to your project. Click on your project's dropdown in the menu bar, and select Invite to Project from the dropdown. You will be presented with a form to specify your friend or email address, so they can get on board with you. You can select whether your new team member will join the project as an Follower, a Member, or anAdministrator.

### User Roles
People can join a project with any of the following user roles:

#### Follower
> A follower can simply view the project information but cannot modify anything. Users browsing public projects are acting on an Follower role.

#### Project Member
> Project members can create sprints, tasks and items. They can move items between sprints, or to the backlog. They can assign items and tasks to themselves or other team members. They can invite other people to the team. In general, they can perform all actions, except for deleting a project.

#### Administrator
> An administrator has full rights over the project. In addition to a Project Member's actions, they can also delete projects.

## Integrations
### API Integration
When enabling API integration for a project, you will be able to retrieve all available data of your project.
You may use it to generate your own custom reports or even use it to store local backup.

For more info please refer to the [API Integration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/integrations/api.md %}) 
instructions.

### GitHub Integration
When enabling GitHub integration for a project, you will be able to see which commit is part of which 
task (or card). A quick link to the GitHub commit is available. You will also be able to update tasks and 
cards with simple Flying Donut commands from within the commit comment. For example, you can to update 
time left of a task to 5 hours by typing `#1556 -left 5h` in the commit comment.

## Agile & Scrum
### What is Agile?
From Wikipedia:
> Agile software development is a group of software development methods based on iterative and incremental 
> development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, 
> cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed 
> iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

See the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) for more.

### What is Scrum?
From Wikipedia:
> Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing software projects 
> and product or application development. Its focus is on "a flexible, holistic product development strategy 
> where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal" as opposed to a "traditional, sequential 
> approach". 

See the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) for more.

### Scrum Sprints, Backlog, and Tasks
When you follow the Scrum methodology, you start with outlining the high-levelitems that define your project. These items the project backlog. You then break the project down into phases, called sprints, and assign the items to the different sprints. Each sprint a start and end date. Your project can be comprised of parallel sprints, with teams working in parallel, or sequential sprints, where the same team completes each sprint in term.

When you assign an item to an sprint, you can provide a more detailed checklist, a set of tasks, that further explain the high-level item to be accomplished.

In simple terms: think of defining different tasks for your project, and assigning deadlines for completing a set of these tasks.
